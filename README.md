# Journey_Lua_Modder
A python GUI application aiming to make Lua injection to the game "Journey" easier. 

Also works in the game "Flower" with minor changes. (do not copy Tick.lua from here, instead just put the function details in the existing file)

### How to install:

Download JourneyLuaModder.py, TickHook.lua, and StartLua.lua to Journey root folder.

Modify \_\_Tick.lua.gz with our changes and _carefully_ embed it into Journey.exe according to this tutorial made by Alazar88:

(You need to get approved in the modding forum to view the thread)

__Optional recommendations:__
- Patch your modding exe via steamless to disable Steam launching redirection, still requires Steam running. 
- Use a emulator when modding to avoid impacting others gameplay.

Requires Python 3.6+, run pythonw JourneyLuaModder.py 

This tool is a work in progress. many functionalities will add on from time to time.
